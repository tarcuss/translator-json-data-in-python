# Translator json data in python

- In this project, data in json format was translated using Python.
- The deep_translator module of the GoogleTranslator library was used.
- Instead of all the data in the data, certain elements have been translated. These are description and foodNutrients[?].nutrient.name.
- Data and output suitable for the code are given for review.
- Translated from English to Turkish.

As a result of the analysis:
- The resulting output is consistent and usable in real life.
- However, the output generation time is very long (approximately 33kb per 30 second).
