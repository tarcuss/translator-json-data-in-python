# Translator json data in python

- In this project, data in json format was translated using Python.
- The deep_translator module of the GoogleTranslator library was used.
- Instead of all the data in the data, certain elements have been translated. These are description and foodPortions.portionDescription .
- Data and output suitable for the code are given for review.
- Translated from English to Turkish.
- If you close it, the program will save the converted data to the created file.
- You can watch the stream from the terminal.

As a result of the analysis:
- The resulting output is consistent and usable in real life.
- However, the output generation time is very long (approximately 8kb per 1 second).
- Sometimes when the code is stopped manually, the recorded data may be incorrect.
